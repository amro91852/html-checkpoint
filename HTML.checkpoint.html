                <p>Kernell, who is of Sami heritage, spoke passionately about the Sami beliefs in curses and how she
                    <br>
                    personally thought she was cursed as a young woman. The jury said, “The pitch was deeply personal
                    <br>
                    and truly compelling. It promises a unique story about love in a lonely world, focusing on healing
                    <br>
                    rather than victimizing as it allows us into a young woman´s journey into breaking a curse. We were
                    <br>
                    impressed by the vision, depth, and sincerity of the project.”

        <p>In the works in progress presentations, Hvistendahl’s Handling The Undead was a stand-out. “It’s a drama <br>
            that’s playing with horror and uncomfortable elements,” said producer Kristin Emblem of Einar Film. <br>
            TrustNordisk handles sales and Neon has already swooped up US rights.</p>
